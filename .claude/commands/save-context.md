Update CLAUDE.md with everything built or discussed in this session.

Capture:
- New files created (with one-line purpose descriptions)
- Architectural decisions and the reasoning behind them
- Bugs found and how they were fixed
- Key gotchas discovered
- Current status and what's untested or incomplete
- Any changes to the development workflow or project config

Remove stale "NEXT SESSION WORK ITEM" sections that have already been completed.
Keep existing accurate content — only update what changed or add what's missing.
Be concise but complete: a future session reading only CLAUDE.md should have full project context.
